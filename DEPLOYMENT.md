## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)

1. **Authenticate with Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npx vercel login
   # Follow the browser authentication process
   ```

2. **Link the project (if not already linked):**
   ```bash
   npx vercel link
   # Choose the existing project or create new one
   ```

3. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod --yes
   ```

### Option 2: Using the Deployment Script

```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Option 3: GitHub Integration (Auto-deployment)

If Vercel is connected to GitHub, deployment should be automatic:

1. Push changes to main branch (already done)
2. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
3. The build should automatically trigger

## 📊 Test Results

- **After fixes:** 14 test failures
- **Improvement:** 92% reduction in failures

## 🔍 Manual Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the fixes:

3. **Navigation Links:** Verify "Lend" link appears in header
4. **Test Attributes:** Use browser dev tools to find data-testid elements

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. **Authentication:** Ensure you're logged into Vercel CLI
